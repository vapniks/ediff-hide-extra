;; This package sets some default regexps for hiding lines based on `major-mode'
;; of ediff buffers when #h is pressed.
;;

;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `ediff-hide-regexp-defaults-alist' : regexps matching lines to hide for each major-mode
;;
;; 
;;;;


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put ediff-hide-extra.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'ediff-hide-extra)
;;
;; Add `ediff-hide-regexp-defaults-alist' to the list of functions in `ediff-prepare-buffer-hook' :
;;
;; M-x customize-variable RET ediff-prepare-buffer-hook RET
;;
