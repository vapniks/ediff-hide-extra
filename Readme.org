This package sets some default regexps for hiding lines based on `major-mode'
of ediff buffers when #h is pressed.

* Installation
Put ediff-hide-extra.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
(you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).

Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'ediff-hide-extra)

Add `ediff-hide-regexp-defaults-alist' to the list of functions in `ediff-prepare-buffer-hook' :

M-x customize-variable RET ediff-prepare-buffer-hook RET
* Customizable Options

 - `ediff-hide-regexp-defaults-alist' : regexps matching lines to hide for each major-mode
